# 4. Semantic segmentation: CamSeq2007

Image segmentation with pytorch?

In an image classification task the network assigns a label (or class) to each input image. However, suppose you want to
know the shape of that object, which pixel belongs to which object, etc. In this case you will want to assign a class to
each pixel of the image. This task is known as segmentation. A segmentation model returns much more detailed intofmation
about the image. Image segmentation has many applications in medical imaging, self-driving cars and satellite imaging to
name a few.
